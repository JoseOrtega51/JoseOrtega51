## 📂 My Projects  

Here are a few highlights:  

### 🌊 Computational Physics
- [LAVAFLOW_TFG](https://github.com/JoseOrtega51/LAVAFLOW1D_TFG): Implementation of a numerical solver for a modification of the Shallow Water Equations that model highly temperature-dependent flows, such as lava. This work was published in [Journal of Computational Physics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2024.113378).
- [Charge_distribution_conductor](https://github.com/JoseOrtega51/Charge_distribution_conductor): Code in C++ that computes the charge distribution on a perfect conductor in the presence of an electric field.

### 🧮 Quantitative Finance  
- [OPTION_PRICING](https://github.com/JoseOrtega51/OPTION_PRICING): Functions in C++ that price European Options and Barrier Options (up-and-out) using a Monte Carlo method with a Geometric Brownian Motion. The analytical solutions for these cases (Black and Scholes) are implemented in Python, which makes it possible to study the convergence of the method.

### 🛠️ Other projects
- [Miscellaneous_repo](https://github.com/JoseOrtega51/Miscellaneous_repo): Collection of a variety of small programs and scripts about Physics, Math or other fields.
  - oscillator_GreenFunction: Solves the forced and damped harmonic oscillator using Green's Function.
  - Duffing_Oscillator_Chaos: Computing the solutions of Duffing's oscillator with Runge Kutta method. Great introduction to Chaos Theory and fractality.
  - Mandelbrot_set: Computing the Mandelbrot set in C++ and creating images from the obtained data in Matlab/Octave.
  - Leja-ordering: Orders a finite set of real numbers based on Leja's ordering. This is very useful for improving Newton's interpolation method.
